#User Stories

* As player 2, I should be able to input letters to guess what the word is.
* As player 2, I should be able to see which letters I have guessed correctly.
* As player 2, I should be able to see how many more guesses I have until I lose by the state of the hangman image.
* As player 2, I should know that I have guessed the full word and have won because the letters will have replaced all of the dashes.
